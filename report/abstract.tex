Sign language is the preferred method of communication among the deaf and the hearing impaired people all over the world. Recognition of sign language can have a varying degree of success when used in a computer vision or any other methods. Sign language is said to have a structured set of gestures in which each gesture is having a specific meaning.
Initially, the gestures are recognised using image data using a convolutional neural network.  In the next step video, based hand gesture recognition is done.  
American sign language dataset is used here.
