\chapter{Requirement Analysis}

\section{Purpose}
\par
Sign language has been widely used in the deaf community. In the foreseeable future, gesture inputs can be idely applied for human-computer interface. Most recent works related to hand gesture interface techniques include: glove based technique, vision-based technique, and analysis of drawing gesture. Vision-based technique is the
most natural way of constructing a human-computer interface which has many applications  \\

A proper system is needed to address the communication issues faced by deaf people. As the area of image processing and machine learning is now in the best position to technically make solutions feasible for the real world usage scenario specially in health stream. \\

\section{Overall Description}
\par
Sign Language Recognition is a model for a sign language understanding system which can be incorporated different hardware or large scale applications to help deaf people. In this project .\\

The system follows deep learning model to create a more accurate system that can be deployed in reallife scenarios. Here we are using the concept of transfer learning. Modern image recognition models have millions of parameters. Training
them from scratch requires a lot of labeled training data and a lot of
computing power (hundreds of GPU-hours or more). Transfer learning is
a technique that shortcuts much of this by taking a piece of a model that
has already been trained on a related task and reusing it in a new model. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linux
    \item Python 3
    \item pip
    \item Keras

\section{Functional Requirements}
The system is should be designed to accept all sort of images and live videos.The following functional requirements have been
identified for this project. The proposed system consists of 2 modules. They are
given below: 

Image based evaluation on sign language recognition
and live video based evaluation. The system should be able to fetch images as well as videos. 

\section{Performance Requirements}
Even if the system works in CPU, it would be better to use GPU so that the system can be more accurately designed and it affects the performance of the system. Higher training steps will take a longer time in CPUs and whereas the GPU will be handling it so easy that models can be developed within hours of training.
