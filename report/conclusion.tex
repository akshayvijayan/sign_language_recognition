\chapter{Conclusion}

\par
The project has addressed the issue of Sign Language Recognition. This project is a module which can be incorporated with any other system including hardware for building some fully automated machines. The software is designed in such a way that future modification can be
done easily. The following conclusions can be deduced from the development of the project: It provides an abstract platform between the user and avoid manual work.
CNN inception v3 model has improved the efficiency as discussed before.


In future works we can incorporate other sign languages to the system so that the user will be able to choose his communication language. Video action based recognition can also be included so that all sort of gestures will also be used for recognition.


As we know when no image is supplied or an illegal image is
provide then too the CNN would classify the false image into a
class. This is the major drawback in using CNN. Reducing false
positive would also be a priority work\\
