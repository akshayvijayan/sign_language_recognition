Sign language (SL) is a visual-gestural language used by deaf and hard-hearing people for communication purposes. Three dimensional spaces and the hand movements are used (and other parts of the body) to convey meanings. It has its own vocabulary and syntax which is purely different from spoken languages/written language. Spoken languages use the oratory faculties to produce sounds mapped against specific words and
grammatical combinations to convey meaningful information. Then the oratory elements are received by the auditory faculties and processed accordingly. Sign language uses the visual faculties which is different from spoken language. Spoken language makes use of rules to produce comprehensive messages; similarly sign language
is also governed by a complex grammar.\\

Gesture recognition is gaining importance in many applications areas such as human interface, communication, multimedia and security. Typically Sign recognition is related as image understanding. This project contains two modules: Sign language recognition from images and recognition from live video stream. Deep learning and image processing are used for achieving the same. \\
